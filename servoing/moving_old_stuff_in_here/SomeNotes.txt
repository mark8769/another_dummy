Some Notes About Additional Things I have done:
    
I moved the include folder, python folder, src folder, test folder
from a clone I made of someones repo for the lidar lite

These can all be found in

/home/pi/sphero/projects/servoing

I do not know how to import from other directories yet
So I just copied and pasted the lidar_lite.py file from
the python folder so I could use the lidar lite with the Sphero RVR
Im sure there is a way to import from different directories
or moving files so it works without having duplicates
but id rather not mess with the project file structure.

When trying to run the program I needed another library

I did

pip install smbus
