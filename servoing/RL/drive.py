# Code Purpose: Given a drive command, move a Sphero Rover using the command.
#
# NOTE: Right now driver() uses the same speed for both left & right tracks,
# this is not a requirement. So if you want you can add left/right speed params
# and trying to implement gradual turning while moving forward/back.
